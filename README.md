I implimented model using iris.data.csv data set for classifying species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor) using features from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. This project is organized as follows:

(a) extract features from data set.
(b) data preprocessing and split into train and test data for given model.
(c) basic SVM classification model
(d) summary of model output.

iris.data.csv:  data set for given model.

Result:
1. SVM-linear: decision tree:Accuracy on test data for a given model is 0.92
2. SVM-poly: decision tree:Accuracy on test data for a given model is 0.9
3. SVM-rbf: decision tree:Accuracy on test data for a given model is 0.9
